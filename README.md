## Context
This is a collection of small library/scripts based on ete/biopython for phylogenetic analysis that I wrote for other projects. Some of them have proven to be quite useful, as I reuse them often.
I don't want to maintain a repository for each of them so I am bundling them together into one super repository. Each parent-level folder is home to a module. This list will gradually grow (whenever I have some time to reorganize old code scattered across my hard-drive).
The main objective is to prevent future students of the lab to unnecessary rewrite code ... 

**Warning** : Missing documentation ... 

### Current list 
- TreeLib :  Extension of ete Tree module with several useful functions and code to perform tree simulation, distance-based clustering, etc ...
- SelBias :  Module to assess (purifying/positive) selection and relaxation on branches of a tree.
